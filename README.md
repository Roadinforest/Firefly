**Capture the glow of a fleeting thought, and share it when you're together.**

**Firefly** is a private, asynchronous sharing application designed for long-distance couples and anyone seeking deeper, more meaningful communication. It allows you to capture those brilliant, transient moments of inspiration‚Äîlike catching fireflies in a jar‚Äîto share and cherish when you finally reunite.

## ‚ú® Core Concept

We believe the best conversations aren't always instantaneous. Some thoughts, feelings, and discoveries deserve to be savored and anticipated.

Firefly is built on two core principles: **asynchronous sharing** and a **sense of ceremony**.

-   **Capture:** You watch a great movie, hear a song that touches your soul, snap a funny picture, or have a whimsical late-night thought. Instantly turn it into a "firefly" and place it in your shared jar.
-   **Anticipate:** Watch as the jar slowly fills with glowing lights. Each light represents a story, a feeling, a piece of jejich world they can't wait to share with you. This sense of anticipation is a precious nutrient for any relationship, especially across distances.
-   **Share:** When you're finally together, open the jar. You can randomly pick a firefly and let the stories unfold. Each share becomes a unique, surprising, and deeply connecting experience.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

This project is a full-stack TypeScript monorepo managed with `pnpm` workspaces.

-   **Frontend (packages/web):**
    -   **Framework:** React 18 + Vite
    -   **Language:** TypeScript
    -   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (via `@tailwindcss/vite`)
    -   **State Management:** Zustand
    -   **Data Fetching:** TanStack Query (React Query)
    -   **Routing:** React Router

-   **Backend (packages/api):**
    -   **Framework:** Nest.js
    -   **Language:** TypeScript
    -   **Database:** PostgreSQL
    -   **ORM:** Prisma
    -   **Authentication:** Passport.js + JWT

-   **Dev Tools:**
    -   **Package Manager:** pnpm Workspace
    -   **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
    -   **Containerization:** Docker Compose

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
-   Node.js (v18+ LTS recommended)
-   pnpm (`npm install -g pnpm`)
-   Git
-   Docker and Docker Compose (or Docker Desktop)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/firefly.git
    cd firefly
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    From the project root, `pnpm` will automatically install dependencies for all workspace packages.
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Start the Database**
    A `docker-compose.yml` file is provided for convenience. This will start a PostgreSQL database in a Docker container.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

4.  **Set Up Environment Variables**
    The backend API needs to know how to connect to the database.
    ```bash
    cd packages/api
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    The default `.env` file is pre-configured to connect to the Docker container, so no changes are usually needed.

5.  **Run Database Migrations**
    This command will create all the necessary tables in your new database based on the Prisma schema.
    ```bash
    # Still in the packages/api directory
    pnpm prisma migrate dev
    ```

6.  **Start the Development Servers**
    You'll need two separate terminal windows for this.
    
    -   **Terminal 1: Start the Backend API**
        ```bash
        cd packages/api
        pnpm run start:dev
        ```
        The backend will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

    -   **Terminal 2: Start the Frontend Web App**
        ```bash
        cd packages/web
        pnpm run dev
        ```
        The frontend will be running at `http://localhost:5173` (or another available port).

You can now open your browser and navigate to the frontend URL to start using Firefly!
